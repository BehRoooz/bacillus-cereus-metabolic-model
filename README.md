Genome-scale Metabolic Model of Bacillus cereus 

Bacillus cereus is a microorganism with industrial application potential.
Thus, a genome scale metabolic model could be used to simulate and optimized the production of its industrial products.
In this study, a genome-scale metabolic network was reconstructed. 
Unbalanced and unconnected reactions were detected and removed, GPR associations obtained and biomass reactions was added to the network.
The prepared metabolic network of Bacillus cereus is the first step of the genome scale metabolic model reconstruction, so it needs more curation and experimentation to complete.
